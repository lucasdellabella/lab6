particle filter, create mapping
if cubeA: RRT to cube A, RRT to drone, place down
if cubeB: RRT to cube B, RRT to drone, place down
if cubeC: RRT to cube C, RRT to drone, place down
if cubeD: RRT to cube C, RRT to drone, place down
go to cubes in order

Step 1:
  Get recognition code from Lab2 working
  DONE: save model

Step 2:
  2a. run particle filter, see if it works at all
  2b. Create map of {marker: marker_name}

Step 3:
Particle filter
Pick a corner that has a cube
Drive to cube
Pick up
Drive to cube destination
Drop off
