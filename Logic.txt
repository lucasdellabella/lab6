particle filter, create mapping
if cubeA: RRT to cube A, RRT to drone, place down
if cubeB: RRT to cube B, RRT to drone, place down
if cubeC: RRT to cube C, RRT to drone, place down
if cubeD: RRT to cube C, RRT to drone, place down
go to cubes in order

Step 1:
  Get recognition code from Lab2 working
  DONE: save model

Step 2:
  DONE: 2a. run particle filter, see if it works at all
  2b. Create map of {marker: marker_name}

    i. get unique IDs of each marker from grid.markers
    ii. localize robot with particle filtering
    iii. continue driving in circle, detect markers and decide which of the markers the detected marker is
          -- Maybe take the global position of each of the markers, and find the nearest neighbor to the observed_marker
    iv. create mapping of marker_name: absolute_grid_location to use as 'goal'
    v. if len(marker_locations) == 6: move to planning section
       else: goto step iii.


        once we've created this mapping we need to RRT

Step 3:
  Use RRT to plan path to Cube, and plan path to goal_pos as defined by the pdf

Step 3:
Particle filter
Pick a corner that has a cube
Drive to cube
Pick up
Drive to cube destination
Drop off
